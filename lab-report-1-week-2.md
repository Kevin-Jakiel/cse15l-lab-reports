# Lab Report 1
## April 1st 2022 & April 8th 2022
### ****Lab 1** *April 1st 2022***

Here is the [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17jT1E99qHO9q5prd-BPDhzNqIDCAVYAtavVzt3bCg10/edit#heading=h.4o1hnbkz6val) to week 1 lab report write up.

In the lab we learned how to remotely connect to the schools computer using ssh *User-name@ieng6.ucsd.edu*

After we logged in and used some commands on the terminal on the remote computers. We made a file a WhereAmI.java and copied it from our computer to the remote computer using *scp*

Copying files and logging into the ssh account with the password takes a lot of time. So we learned how to create a **ssh keygen** so that we dont have to manually log into our remote computer account every time

In Lab 1 we learned how to access and control the remote servers using ssh, how to copy files with scp, and creating ssh keygens so we dont have to use a password everytime we want to log into the remote account.

# ****Lab 2** *April 8th 2022***

In the [second lab](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nw6gdehL-BzqjeVV1jzi_Ni4cdpx2uquLztLGTdzUdU/edit#heading=h.49e6dmnl0l3f) for CSE 15L we learned about Git, GitHub, and GitHub Pages *(what your looking at right now)*.

At the start of Lab 2, we created a a GitHub account and created our first [repository](https://github.com/Kevin-Jakiel/cse15l-lab-reports/tree/main).

In the repository we created our first file called "index.md" on the GitHub website and published it.

Editing files on the GitHub website takes up a lot of time and can slow you down. To solve the ineffiency we downloaded the GitHub Desktop app and cloned the repository from GitHub to the app.

After cloning the repository to the Desktop App we can open the files in VS Code and edit and view the updates at the same time.

In Lab 2, we learned about Git, GitHub, GitHub pages, how to add files to your repository, how to edit them, how to edit files offline and upload them to the remote repository on the GitHub Website
